# Ubuntu, set, go

*Ubuntu, set, go* is a simple cli tool that lets you build your Ubuntu configuration just the way you like it.

It's all contained in a single file that you can save on Github or wherever you like. Whenever you install a fresh copy of Ubuntu into a new machine, just run:

```
ubuntusetgo my/configuration/file.toml
```

## Why

Coming from MacOS, I'm used to the simplicity of logging in with my iCloud credentials, and finding that within a few minutes my new MacBook would look and feel almost exactly like my old one. 

This is even more the case with smartphones. When you get a new iPhone or Android, you know that within minutes you can get it to the point where you have everything you need, configured exactly like you had it on your older device.

There's nothing of the sort in Linuxland. Seeing as use Ubuntu, which is supposedly a very user friendly distro, I thought something needed to be done. 

With *Ubuntu, set, go* I no longer need to fear the moment when my laptop is inevitably going to give up the ghost. I can be excited about getting a new machine, knowing that within minutes I can be up and running, ready to work.
